        <h2>What are water bears</h2>

        <p>Tardigrades, colloquially known as "water bears," are a diverse group of eight-legged invertebrates that can be up to half a millimeter in length.<br> 
            "They look like tiny sausages with legs," says Javier Ortega Hernández, a paleobiologist at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology.<br>
            Tardigrades have captivated the popular imagination in part because they can nearly halt their metabolism for long periods—a feat known as cryptobiosis—to endure hellish conditions.

        <h2>Water bears superpower</h2>

        <p>They can survive deadly radiation, arctic temperatures, the vacuum of space, and even bullet impacts.<br> 
            You can find them anywhere there's water—in the ocean, freshwater, and plants and soil.<br>
            But the evolutionary roots of these microscopic, mostly aquatic creatures called tardigrades have been mysterious because of their sparse fossil record.
